# Multi_class_animal_classification
My first project in AI/ML!
Hii Everyone I am diving deep into AI and ML. This project on Multi Class Animal Classification is created on jupyter notebook.
I gained valuable experiences into the various Python Libraries.
I gained hands-on Python libraries including:
-> Numpy
-> Matplotlib 
-> TensorFlow and its Keras API.
The dataset was gathered from Kaggle which helped me in the project.
I also used the Pyplot module of the Matplotlib Library to plot the images and show them on the screen.
Then for the Data Preprocessing part -> I defined the image size and the batch size of the images.
ImageDataGenerator is used for rescaling and validation splitting.
Created Training and Validation Generators.
At last mapped the classes using the train_generator and extracted the class names

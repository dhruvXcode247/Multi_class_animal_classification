# Multi_class_animal_classification
My first project in AI/ML!
Hii Everyone I am diving deep into AI and ML. This project on Multi Class Animal Classification is created on jupyter notebook. I gained valuable experiences into the various Python Libraries.
I gained hands-on Python libraries including Numpy, Matplotlib , TensorFlow and its Keras API.
 The dataset was gathered from Kaggle which helped me in the project.
